            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p id="about">
From an early age, I was captivated by the world of computers, delving into the realm of hacking out of curiosity and a desire to understand how systems function. This early exploration led me down a path where I learned the intricacies of cybersecurity, often on the edge of ethical boundaries. However, as I matured, my perspective shifted. I realized the impact I could have by using my skills for good. 

Today, I channel my expertise into helping individuals and organizations enhance their computer security and navigate the digital landscape safely. My journey from a young hacker to a dedicated advocate for cybersecurity reflects my commitment to empowering others and protecting them in an increasingly complex online world.
