        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="about">
          From an early age, I was captivated by the world of computers, delving
          into the realm of hacking out of curiosity and a desire to understand
          how systems function. This early exploration led me down a path where
          I learned the intricacies of cybersecurity, often on the edge of
          ethical boundaries. However, as I matured, my perspective shifted. I
          realized the impact I could have by using my skills for good. Today, I
          channel my expertise into helping individuals and organizations
          enhance their computer security and navigate the digital landscape
          safely. My journey from a young hacker to a dedicated advocate for
          cybersecurity reflects my commitment to empowering others and
          protecting them in an increasingly complex online world.
